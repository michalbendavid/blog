  <h1>My personal midlife crisis</h1>
  <h2>introduction</h2>
  <section>At the age of forty-five, many things started to change,  during couples therapy with my husband,
           it suddenly became clear to me that maybe I should check where I'm going, and what exactly I want to do with my life.  
           For many, many years the path was automatic, studies in school, then high school, and in Israel it is clear that immediately after high school comes military service.
           After my discharge from the army, I immediately started university, even my choice of profession was by default, I went to study law, because that's what my friends at the time were doing.
After school, there is obviously law internship, and that's where I met my beloved husband, at the Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court. Pretty soon we got married, bought an apartment,
took out a mortgage, had three charming loving and talented children. We built a small and loving family law office, which supports us with dignity to this day,
and specializes in mediation. As I like to say, we are lawyers who help people solve problems, not lawyers who help people create new problems.
Then, when the children were all in their teenage years, and we paid all the mortgage, I raised my head a little, and looked around, and a little later, the corona virus came which added to the whole mess.</section>
So, what is missing?
I think it's actually a combination of several things:
• The corona effect:
Suddenly, I felt that life was fragile. People were infected with a dangerous disease, many were hospitalized, several times a day I was updated on websites about morbidity and death data in Israel, in different cities in the area where I live and work. Everyone went into lockdown, studying from home, working from home, everything changed completely.
• Feeling of lack of control in life:
The schedule became impossible. You can plan a day ahead at most, and even then, plans constantly changed at very short notice.
• What I want to do in my life:
Although thank God, I was very blessed in many ways, a loving family, husband, children, a beautiful home, work, and livelihood, I felt, as I wrote in the introduction, that the path chose me, when it should be the other way around. And I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, while I still had time left, and then I started thinking.

• I had no girlfriends:
I am a friendly person by nature, at least that's how I feel, but apart from my husband, who stands by me in all the difficult moments, I had no friends with whom I could share the good and the difficult moments of my life, laugh, gossip, and spend time, despite the loving and wonderful family around me, I felt a huge lack of friends.

So, what am I doing?
If I try to think how things started for me, then it goes something like this:
• Consult a person I trust:
I asked myself, I asked the therapist, and I didn't find an answer, and I was very frustrated. Then I consulted with a lawyer and a mediator, a co-worker, who gave me a small but significant piece of advice that set many processes in motion after that.
 She told me "Go to an afternoon class". A class always seems to me to be something for children, who go to classes after school, but I went for it.
• Go to a class I like:
I always liked drawing. I was in a drawing class as a girl for several years. So, I joined a drawing class. I met one good friend there, someone I had fun talking to, she is about my age, and we found a common language. I suddenly had another world, that the children are not a part of, that my husband is not a part of. The painting itself also did me good, I remembered how much I love to paint, and I enjoy it even today, 3 years after I joined the class. As soon as I remembered what it's like to have friends, I found more friends from drawing lessons, as well as from other places and we also meet for various leisure activities. It's hard for me today to think about what it was like to be without friends.
• Find a volunteer activity:
Later I realized that the class was just the beginning. I missed contributing from myself, helping, and using my abilities to do good. Then I heard about volunteering at the Nature and Parks Authority in Israel, in a project to preserve and restore the sea turtle population in Israel.
At the beginning I volunteered as a beach comber. At the start of the sea turtle nesting season, in May, once a week, I would get up at 4:45 in the morning, and leave before sunrise to walk a 2 km stretch of beach and look for tracks of sea turtles that came ashore to lay eggs during the night. The goal is to locate the nests laid by sea turtles on populated beaches, and to move the eggs to a safe area protected from the dangers of predators and people who might accidentally damage the nests (I didn't find sea turtle nests, but I saw many beautiful sunrises, and lovely beaches). When the egg hatching season came on July, I volunteered to be a nanny for the hatchlings. I would sleep once a week at night in the nature reserve on the beach, in the protected place where they moved all the turtle nests that were found, with one or two other volunteers, and every half hour during the night, we checked the nests. If the little turtles hatched, we counted them, recorded the number of the nest, and the type of turtles (green or brown), and released them about 20 m from the shore, making sure that they go safely to the sea, and that no one harms them or eats them on the way (there are quite a few crabs that have tried) And they are going in the right direction. Walking on the beach is very important, because it is what allows them to return in their adulthood and lay their eggs in the same place. This volunteering enriched my world and gave me a lot of satisfaction. I freed hundreds of small and charming sea tutrtles and discovered an amazing world.
• Decision to embark on a new independent professional career:
After the sea turtle season ended, and after the fog of the corona virus started to spread a little, I thought, is this career of mine, working in an independent office together with my husband, is what I want to do throughout my working life?
Then I started checking options and reading a bit, and the field of software development turned out to be a possibility, and a field that is constantly evolving. I took some online courses, and it seemed interesting to me, and I started looking for study options. With the help of my husband, who read an article about MasterSchool, I decided to try that and happily I was accepted. I started web development studies, hoping that I would be able to integrate as a worker in the industry and make a decent living from the new profession.

In conclusion:
And now - I'm here. This blog was written during the third project that I submit for studies. I decided to use my story instead of "Loram Ipsum". I really hope that I was successful in the project, and I look forward to seeing what else the future holds.
