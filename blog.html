        <h1>My Midlife Crisis Blog</h1>
        <h2>Introduction - Who needs a crisis?</h2>
        <p>
          At the age of forty-five, many things started to change. One day, it
          suddenly became clear to me that maybe I should check where I'm going,
          and what exactly I want to do with my life.<em
            >For many, many years the path was automatic.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Going to school, then high school. In Israel it is clear that
          immediately after high school comes military service. After my
          discharge from the army, I immediately started university, even my
          choice of profession was by default, I went to study law, because
          that's what my friends at the time were doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          After law school, there is obviously law internship, and that's where
          I met my beloved husband, at the Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pretty soon we got married, bought an apartment, took out a mortgage,
          had three charming loving and talented children.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built a small and loving family law office, which supports us with
          dignity to this day, and specializes in mediation. As I like to say,
          we are lawyers who help people solve problems, not lawyers who help
          people create new problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, when the children were all in their teenage years, and we paid
          all the mortgage,<em> I had the time to look around, and think.</em>
          and a little later, <em>the corona virus came.</em> That was the end
          of the world as we know it.
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-was-missing">what was missing in my life?</h2>
        <p>I think it's actually a combination of several things:</p>
        <h3>The corona effect:</h3>
        <p>
          Suddenly, I felt that life was fragile. People were infected with a
          dangerous disease, many were hospitalized, several times a day I was
          updated on websites about morbidity and death data in Israel, in
          different cities in the area where I live and work. Everyone went into
          lockdown, studying from home, working from home, everything changed
          completely.
        </p>
        <h3>Feeling of lack of control in life:</h3>
        <p>
          The schedule became impossible. You can plan a day ahead at most, and
          even then, plans constantly changed at very short notice.
        </p>
        <h3>What I want to do in my life:</h3>
        <p>
          Thank God, I was very blessed in many ways, a loving family, husband,
          children, a beautiful home, providing career and a Golden retriever...
          <em
            >But stiil I felt, that the path chose me, when it should be the
            other way around.</em
          >
          And I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, while I still had
          time left.
        </p>
        <h3>I had no girlfriends:</h3>
        <p>
          I am a friendly person by nature, at least that's how I feel, but
          apart from my husband, who stands by me in all the difficult moments,
          I had no friends with whom I could share the good and the difficult
          moments of my life, laugh, gossip, and spend time.

      <article id="what-can-i-do" class="second-post">
        <h2>What can I do?</h2>
        <p>
          If I try to think how things started for me, then it goes something
          like this:
        </p>
        <h3>Consult a person I trust:</h3>
        <p>
          I asked myself, I asked the therapist, and I didn't find an answer,
          and I was very frustrated. Then I consulted with a lawyer and a
          mediator, a co-worker, who gave me a small but significant piece of
          advice that set many processes in motion after that. She told me "Go
          to an afternoon class". A class always seems to me to be something for
          children, who go to classes after school, but I went for it.
        </p>
        <h3>Going to evening drawing class:</h3>
        <p>
          I always liked drawing. I was in a drawing class as a girl for several
          years. So, I joined a drawing class. I met one good friend there,
          someone I had fun talking to, she is about my age, and we found a
          common language. I suddenly had another world, that the children are
          not a part of, that my husband is not a part of.The painting itself
          also did me good, I remembered how much I love to paint, and I enjoy
          it even today, 3 years after I joined the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as I remembered what it's like to have friends, I found more
          friends from drawing lessons, as well as from other places and we also
          meet for various leisure activities. It's hard for me today to think
          about what it was like to be without friends.
        </p>
        <h3>Volunteering activity:</h3>
        <p>
          Later I realized that the class was just the beginning. I missed
          contributing from myself, helping, and using my abilities to do good.
          Then I heard about volunteering at the Nature and Parks Authority in
          Israel, in a project to preserve and restore the sea turtle population
          in Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the beginning I volunteered as a beach comber. At the start of the
          sea turtle nesting season, in May, once a week, I would get up at 4:45
          in the morning, before sunrise, to walk a 2 km stretch of beach and
          look for tracks of sea turtles that came ashore to lay eggs during the
          night. The goal is to locate the nests laid by sea turtles on
          populated beaches, and to move the eggs to a safe area protected from
          the dangers of predators and people who might accidentally damage the
          nests (I didn't find sea turtle nests, but I saw many beautiful
          sunrises, and lovely beaches).
        </p>
        <p>
          When the egg hatching season came on July, I volunteered to be a nanny
          for the hatchlings. I would sleep once a week at night in the nature
          reserve on the beach, in the protected place where they moved all the
          turtle nests that were found, with one or two other volunteers, and
          every half hour during the night, we checked the nests. If the little
          turtles hatched, we counted them, recorded the number of the nest, and
          the type of turtles (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>
          sea turtles- that have a white belly, or
          <i>Caretta caretta</i> sea turtles - that have a black belly).
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we released them about 20 meters from the shore, making sure that
          they go safely to the sea, and that no one harms them or eats them on
          the way (there are quite a few crabs that have tried) And they are
          going in the right direction. Walking on the beach is very important,
          because it is what allows them to return in their adulthood and lay
          their eggs in the same place. This volunteering enriched my world and
          gave me a lot of satisfaction. I freed hundreds of small and charming
          sea tutrtles and discovered an amazing world.
        </p>
        <h3>Decision to embark on a new independent professional career:</h3>
        <p>
          After the sea turtle season ended, and after the fog of the corona
          virus started to spread a little, I thought, is this career of mine,
          working in an independent office together with my husband, is what I
          want to do throughout my working life?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I started checking options and reading a bit, and the field of
          software development turned out to be a possibility, and a field that
          is constantly evolving. I took some online courses, and it seemed
          interesting to me, and I started looking for study options. With the
          help of my husband, who showed me an article about MasterSchool, I
          decided to try that and happily I was accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started web development studies, hoping that I would be able to
          integrate as a worker in the industry and make a decent living from
          the new profession.
        </p>
        <h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion:</h2>
        <p>
          And now - I'm here. This blog was written during the third project
          that I submit for studies. I decided to use my story instead of "Loram
          Ipsum". I really hope that I was successful in the project.
